## Instructions

* When the user clicks on a button, the page will render 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

* Under every gif, it will display its rating (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
   * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

* Users are allowed to add onto the buttons using the form to input what gis they want to search
